Overview

This project is an automated Excel/Google Sheets tool designed to assist pharmacists and antimicrobial stewardship teams in hospitals. It streamlines data entry, validation, and analysis for antibiotic usage.

Key Features

Automated Data Flow: Once patient or prescription data is entered, it automatically populates the Analysis page.

Data Validation & Alerts:

Empty cells that require data are highlighted in bright colors for quick identification.

Only specific, valid dates can be entered thanks to conditional formatting rules.


AppScript-Powered Extraction: Custom Google Apps Script extracts, synthesizes, and summarizes data for dashboards and reporting.

Clinical Relevance: Enables tracking of antibiotic utilization, identification of gaps in data, and streamlined reporting for stewardship audits.


Technologies Used

Excel / Google Sheets: For structured data entry and analysis

Google Apps Script (JavaScript): For automated extraction, synthesis, and alert mechanisms

Conditional Formatting: For data validation and highlighting gaps


How It Works

1. Enter serial number, the conditional formatting then guides you to what are all the other information that needs to be entered in the input sheet.


2. The script automatically extracts and synthesizes data into the Analysis Sheet.


3. Cells missing required information are highlighted in bright colors to alert the user.


4. Only valid dates can be entered to maintain data integrity.


5. Export or review synthesized reports for antimicrobial stewardship decisions.
